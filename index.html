    <h2>For my Professor🤍</h2>
    <p>
      Honestly, these 8 days with you were the best days of my life. I never felt this kind of peace and relaxation before.
      You turned out to be way more than what I ever expected — seriously, I keep thinking, even if Allah gave me super power
      to read hearts and minds, still I wouldn’t have found a girl like you.<br><br>

      I keep wondering what good deeds I must have done that Allah blessed me with you. You’re just pure peace, and I just
      want to preserve you, make you happy, and see you smiling always.After meeting you, my belief in dua has increased so much. Because I literally got what I exactly mentioned in my prayers.<br><br>

      Now that you’re going to your home, I’m already missing you. Just manifesting that Allah keeps both of us happy — in this duniya and in akhirat, together always ❤️
